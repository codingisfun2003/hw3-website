    <h2>Data Analysis & Visualization Projects</h2>
    
    <p>
        My recent work in data analysis and visualization includes two projects: the Suicide Rates Analysis Project and 
        the Anti-Psych LAAD Project with Alkermes. In the Suicide Rates Analysis Project, I focused on creating an interactive 
        dashboard designed to provide a deeper understanding of suicide trends across different demographics, including age, 
        sex, and ethnicity. This dashboard, built with Holoviz Panel, allows users to filter data and observe 
        trends within specific groups, allowing users to uncover patterns and correlations that might remain hidden 
        in the raw data. Through this project, I honed my skills in data visualization, API integration, and building 
        intuitive, user-focused interfaces, all critical for translating complex datasets into accessible, actionable insights.

        At Alkermes, I contributed to the Anti-Psych LAAD Project, where I developed an interactive Tableau dashboard aimed at 
        enhancing data access for stakeholders in my team. This project was centered on analyzing product growth and performance, 
        providing the companyâ€™s management with real-time, data-driven insights to guide strategic decisions. Using MySQL, I 
        extracted, processed, and analyzed large datasets, transforming them into visual metrics that allowed for immediate 
        and informed decision-making. This experience not only strengthened my technical skills in data manipulation and 
        visualization but also emphasized the importance of clear, goal-oriented data presentation in business environments. 
        Both projects have solidified my interest in using data science to drive impactful, data-driven solutions and have 
        equipped me with the skills to deliver meaningful insights in a professional setting.
