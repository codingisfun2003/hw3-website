    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Samuel Zheng. I'm 21 years old and from Boston, Massachusetts. I live with my mom, dad, younger 
        sister, and grandma in Chinatown. I am going into my fourth year at Northeastern University, majoring in data science. 
        I’ve had the chance to work on several hands-on projects, including creating interactive dashboards and exploring 
        complex datasets. Currently, I’m working on a project analyzing suicide rates across various demographics, where I use 
        visualization tools to reveal trends and insights. In my spare time, I enjoy staying active through basketball, 
        football, snowboarding, hiking, biking, and lifting weights. I’m also an avid gamer, playing games like Valorant, 
        League of Legends, Terraria, and Roblox. Animals are a big part of my life, and I hope to own a calico British 
        shorthair and a Saint Bernard once I secure a job after graduation. I'm aiming to secure a data science role at a 
        company like New Balance, Fidelity, or Hoyoverse, drawn to their innovative, data-driven approaches and the chance to 
        make meaningful contributions. My coursework has equipped me with skills in Python, SQL, and visualization tools like 
        Tableau and Holoviz Panel, and I look forward to expanding my skills in a collaborative and impact-driven environment.
        After graduation, I plan to move from Boston to either New York or California, where I hope to continue my journey in 
        data science and personal growth. I’m excited to learn, contribute, and connect with others who share a drive for 
        innovation.
